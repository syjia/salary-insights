## Business Problem:
- We have a dataset showing item sales and a number of related metrics of the outlets where the items are sold. 
- We want to use these metrics to investigate which factors are the most important determinants of item sales. 
- Eventually, we want to construct a model to estimate the item sales based on the metrics available from our dataset.
## Data:

## Methods
- We conducted exploratory analysis of dataset. Results can be reviewed from [this notebook](https://github.com/syjia/salary-insights/blob/main/Data_Science_Sales_Insights.ipynb)
- We then compared the performance of two machine learning models: **linear regression** and **regression trees**. Results can be found from [this link](https://github.com/jiashenyue/salary-insights/blob/main/machine_learning_sales.ipynb).
